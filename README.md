- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicola Talbot @nlct
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (mostly Java and PHP) and TeX (mostly LaTeX).
- 🌱 I write open source software as an unpaid hobby, although I have occasionally written bespoke software on short contracts.
- 💞️ If you want to support my free software, [LaTeX packages and LaTeX resources](https://www.dickimaw-books.com/latexresources.html) buy one of my books 😉.
I write [fiction](https://www.dickimaw-books.com/fiction) and [non-fiction](https://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex). Alternatively, ask your local library to buy a copy. (E-books are the cheapest.)
- 📫 You can reach me via the [Contact page](https://www.dickimaw-books.com/contact) on the Dickimaw Books site.
